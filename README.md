heterogeneous graph generated by running *global_graph_.py in ./build_graph_glove/

## ASTE-Rele-Sentences
relevant sentences for every sentence in the dataset, which will be used to build graphs.

## models/bert_moodels
save the models with glove 
ts is the model without any graphs
ts0 to ts3 respond to baseline1 to baseline3, which use graph0 to graph3

## bert_models
save the models with bert
there is only one model in bert_init.py that does not use graphs

## run with glove 
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0   python train_with_glove.py  --dataset res14

## run with bert 
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1   python train_with_bert.py --dataset res14
